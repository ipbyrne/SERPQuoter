# SERPQuoter
This is a form I created for an SEO website that takes in keywords and the prospects website. It then uses the SEMRush API to gather information on the keywords entered and where the prospects website is currently ranked for this keywords and builds a quote based off that data.

Once the client receives the response from the server, it populates the webpage with the quote data.

This code is written using HTML, Plain JavaScript for the front-end and Node.JS for the back-end.
